# Here you may customize your own custom macros.
# The configuration is quite simple, each step will be executed in order.
# Each step is formatted as such: ("YOUR_KEYSTROKES_HERE", DELAY_IN_SECONDS_HERE),
# You may add as many steps as you like.
# Mouse inputs are currently unsupported and maybe added later if there is demand.
# Look at the pywinauto documentation send_keystrokes() for any advanced keystrokes you may need, such as holding down a key, etc...
