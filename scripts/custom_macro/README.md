# Custom macro script
This is a custom macro script for Where Winds Meet.
You may edit the config to add custom macros.
Some uses for this script can be to afk farm herbs or fish using tai chi at a pond while standing in one place.

# Future Plans
Future updates may include food buffs and the ability to add a more advanced rotational farming route.
